# Who does not follow me back on Instagram?

- It is trendy to _unfollow_ people on ig nowadays...
- That's fine; I just want to know who deems me not worthy of following so I can unfollow them and **not waste my time** watching their stories, posts etc.

## How to use

1. Download the **following.html** & **followers_1.html** from <https://accountscenter.instagram.com/info_and_permissions/dyi/> (In section "_How much information do you want?_" select "_Some of your information_" and then select "_Followers and following_").
2. Place the downloaded html files into the root of this project.
3. Run the script with `python follow.py`
